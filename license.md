Note. This fork is no more a contribution, rather a total rewrite, including
significant extensions. Therefore, in some future release, I will likely take
the liberty of replacing above one copyright line by the following two-liner :

```
Copyright (C) 2014 Erik Österberg
Copyright (C) 2021 Norbert C. Maier and contributors
```

Note. Also in some future release, I like to replace the MIT License by the
[BSD-3-Clause License](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).
That one is of the same liberty, it just additionally states three otherwise
common sense cases explicitly. The BSD-3-Clause license has a tradition
similiar to the MIT License, you can find it applied e.g. by
[CMake](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake)
or [Highlight.js](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js).
