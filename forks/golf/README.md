terminaljs
==========

terminal.js is a dead simple JavaScript library for emulating a shell environment.


###Initialization

    var myTerminal = new Terminal(id)

###Properties and methods

    .empty()
Prints a blank new line. (HTML contents are &amp;nbsp;)

    .printraw(html)
Prints html-formatted text on a new line. Links and images can be added via respective HTML formatting.

    .load(name, message, width, progress, callback)
Generates a new line with an Id of 'name', and a loading message provided. A loading bar will be generated beside the message with the width provided, in characters. Progress function will be called once every half second to update the progress bar. Progress function should return an integer between 0-100. Progress function will stop and execute callback function when returned value is 100 or greater.

    .clearhistory()
Clears the previous input history.

    .history
This is an array of strings that is the input history

    .lasthistory
Default value of -1, this is the last input displayed from history. This allows scrolling up/down through previous inputs via arrow keys, and clears the input field when down is pressed past defined history.




    .html
This is the top DOM element of the terminal instance. If you want to modify styling via CSS, all instances belong to a .Terminal class. The element will also get the ID from the constructor argument.

    .print(message)
Prints the message on a new line.

    .input(message, callback)
Prints the message, and shows a prompt where the user can write. When the user presses enter, the callback function fires. The callback takes one argument, which is the user input.

    .password(message, callback)
The same as input but the input of the user will be hidden just like an old-fashioned terminal.

    .confirm(message, callback)
Displays a confirm message, with a " (y/n)" automatically appended at the end. The callback receives the yes/no value as a boolean.

    .clear()
Clears the screen.

    .sleep(milliseconds, callback)
Works exactly like the JavaScript "setTimeout" function. Waits for the number of milliseconds given, then executes the callback.

    .beep()
Plays a retro digital tone.

    .setTextSize()
    .setTextColor()
    .setBackgroundColor()
    .setWidth()
    .setHeight()
All the ".set" methods accepts any CSS-compliant value.

    .blinkingCursor(boolean)
Set to true by default.
